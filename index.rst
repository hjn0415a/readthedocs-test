Coding with Kids documentation
==============================
Coding with kids can be a *great*
way to not only teach them some skills
that will help them with their
own lives, but also *create or 
strengthen* some lasting
**bonds between you and them.**

Throughout your journey you will
both likely learn new ``concepts`` and
``terms`` that will expand your horizons and
provide hours of enjoyment.

.. caution::
   Some kids have problems with screen time
   and if you leave them unattended with a
   screen and they have access to things
   like YouTube or game, they may not stay
   focused on the task at hand.

Add your content using ``reStructuredText`` syntax. See the
`reStructuredText <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/index.html>`_
documentation for details.

There are lots of great options for
where to start,
and :doc:`/Options/justlogic` is a great
place to start. Note that
the :doc:`best starting point </Options/justlogic>` is
another way to refer to the same place
but give your link text some title.

For details about the hardware and code options,
see :ref:`Options section for hardware and code <hwcodeOptions>` .
